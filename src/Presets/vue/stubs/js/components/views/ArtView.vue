        FUD & FOMO is an art project by Eivind Kleiven exploring the concept - value of art. With this project Eivind propose a battle theory of value. The theory is expressed using two sculptures sharing a monetary value that can only be retrieved by destroying at least one of the sculptures. If one is destroyed and its monetary value withdrawn, then the monetary value of the remaining undestroyed sculpture will disappear immediately and only its value as art remains.    </p>
